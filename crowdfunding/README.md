# Crowdfunding

Anoncoin is an open source project, and the majority of work is done by volunteers. It is not possible for everyone to contribute their time without payment, however, and there may be other things that would be beneficial for the Anoncoin project that needs to be paid for. This is where those things are pitched, discussed and possibly funded by the community.

Tasks and projects here exist in 4 stages, ideas, proposals, funding required and work in progress. We use the crowdfunding project here on Github to organize this.

## Ideas.
If you have an idea for something you think the Anoncoin community should fund, you can create an issue and it will be added to the ideas column where the community can discuss it.

## Proposals.
A proposal is an idea that the proposer want to develop or organize the development of. This could be an idea that has already been discussed or something new. A proposal should include the following:
Description of the idea.
How you will develop it.
Introduction, who are you and why do you want to develop this?
Costs. How much does it cost to finish the project? Divide costs up into milestones so that each can be paid upon its completion.

## Funding required.
Proposals are discussed by the community. Proposals that receive a positive feedback from the community will be moved to funding required and given an Anoncoin donation address. The project can start as soon as enough money to fund the first milestone has been donated.

## Work in progress.
Once a task is fully funded it will be moved to work in progress. The responsible person is expected to post updates and answer peoples questions as the project moves along.
