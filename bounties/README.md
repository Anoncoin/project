# Bounties

Bounties are clearly defined tasks that we are looking for people to do. That could be development work, marketing, design, etc.

A bounty could start out as a crowdfunding idea, the community like the idea and funds it but there is noone to do the actual task. The task would then be posted here as a bounty.

A bounty may have a time limit attached to it. If noone claims the bounty by that time the amount funded to the bounty would be refunded to the donors or to the general Anoncoin donation fund.

If you want to claim a bounty, create an issue where you refer to the bounty with proof that the bounty has been completed.
