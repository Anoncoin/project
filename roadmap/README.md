## Project history.
Anoncoin was created in June 2013 as the first cryptocurrency with built-in support for I2P and Tor. Anoncoin was released in an entirely transparent manner and with a fair initial coin distribution. Though there was a small pre-mine of 4200 ANC for technical reasons, these coins were returned to the community through a public faucet, bounties, and give-a-ways.

Anoncoin was originally a fork of the Litecoin source code, and it now includes most aspects of Bitcoin Core 0.10. in addition to specific privacy-focused Anoncoin features.

Anoncoin was initially planning to implement Zerocoin in a trustless manner using RSA UFOs. Using RSA UFOs to implement the Zerocoin protocol turned out to be impractical, and we do not want to use a trusted setup. Instead, we want to take a different direction moving forward.

Anoncoin's founder returned to the project in October 2017 together with a small group of new developers. The project is currently in active development. The new team release Anoncoin 0.9.7 on July 13, 2018. The next release will be Anoncash, the next generation of private digital cash.
